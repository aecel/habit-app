# Habit App

## Description

This is a non-punishing app that will help the user form habits. Its main idea is that it takes 66 days to form a habit.

## Rules (In progress)

1. Have two groups: "set habits" and "unset habits"
2. It takes 66 days on average to form a habit, but it's actually a range depending on the person and the habit (from 18 days to 254 days)
3. 66 days is the default streak that you need to have in order to change an "unset habit" to a "set habit"
4. Maybe the number of days can be changed somehow? Idk how. Set it yourself? Or some kind of computation depending on your streaks and broken streaks but I don't want to think about this right now.
5. If a "set habit" is a daily task, and you miss 3 days, it will be demoted to an "unset habit". When this happens, you can provide a reason (or not lol) why the habit was broken so you can revisit it later when you try again.
6. You can only add 1 "unset habit" at a time, to prevent being overwhelmed. This is your main focus.
7. You can add any number of "set habits". Honor system na lang lol.
8. If you have more than 1 "unset habit" somehow, you need to choose between them. You need to delete one. This will gray it out or something idk. Or maybe there's a setting where you can have up to 3 unset habits idk not sure. I'm not sure if this is a good idea lol. Actually baka it might incentivize me to lie lol so maybe don't delete them. Maybe choose na lang which will be your main focus.
9. With "set habits", you don't need to mark them all done, automatic na siya na green everyday because it's annoying to be asked everyday. You only need to mark it if you didn't do it a particular day. Be honest hopefully lol. Maybe there's this  button saying "Yup this is still accurate, I'm still doing it" Last checked some_date_here. If, after a lot of days, you haven't checked that habit, there will be a pop up to ask you to update its status. Idk is that annoying?
10. All days are editable, (green to gray, gray to green) you don't need to check the app everyday. It won't punish you.
11. Hoping on the honesty of the user who is me lol.
12. The only thing you need to mark everyday or every whatever day is your 1 unset habit.
13. If you have been doing your unset habit for 66 days (or whatever number of days), then it would be a big deal, so big dopamine hit lol. You can also start another unset habit.
14. There should be a warning if a set habit is about to be demoted to an unset habit. (2 consecutive days not done)
15. When setting up a new unset habit for the first time, there would be a guide for the user to make it a small step muna. Give examples like, if you want to go to the gym early, make it so that you wake up early muna ganun. The unset habit can also evolve. From "wake up early" to "wake up early and change to gym shoes" and then to "wake up early and change to gym clothes" until you reach your main goal to go to the gym early. Ganern. I'm not completely sure how to implement this. Maybe after a certain number of days, there would be a pop-up asking you to edit the unset habit to its next step or something. Idk. Or make it so that these steps are the children of your main goal.
16. Make the set habits very pretty/cool so it's a dopamine hit when you see them. It should look better the longer it is.
17. There is an option where you only half assed the task. (e.g. You only flossed your bottom teeth instead of all your teeth lol) This will continue your streak pa rin. So there are 3 colors na, gray, dark green, green.
18. You can choose to reward yourself when you hit a number of days that you have set (e.g. I will buy myself a slice of Gouda when I hit 15 days) 
19. Make an option to set an alarm during a particular time. Either that or a trigger/situation. What happens before or after the habit?
20. Display your progress in percentage, current streak, longest streak.
